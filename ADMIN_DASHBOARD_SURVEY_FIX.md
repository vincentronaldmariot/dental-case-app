# Admin Dashboard Survey Data Display Fix

## Issue
The self-assessment survey was not showing in the appointment details on the admin dashboard (`admin_dashboard_screen.dart`).

## Root Cause
The admin dashboard was looking for survey data in the old format (`effectiveSurvey['patient_info']`, `effectiveSurvey['tooth_conditions']`, etc.), but the backend was now providing `parsedSurveyData` with the new 8-question format.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Survey Data Detection
**File**: `lib/admin_dashboard_screen.dart`

**Changes**:
- Modified `effectiveSurvey` detection to prioritize `parsedSurveyData` over `survey_data`
- Added fallback to old format for backward compatibility

```dart
final effectiveSurvey = survey ??
    ((appointment is Map && (appointment as Map).containsKey('parsedSurveyData'))
        ? (appointment as Map)['parsedSurveyData']
        : ((appointment is Map && (appointment as Map).containsKey('survey_data'))
            ? (appointment as Map)['survey_data']
            : null));
```

### 2. Added New Survey Display Method
**File**: `lib/admin_dashboard_screen.dart`

**New Method**: `_buildParsedSurveyQuestions(Map<String, dynamic> surveyData)`

**Features**:
- Displays all 8 survey questions in a clean, organized format
- Each question shows the full question text and patient's answer
- Color-coded answers (Red for "Yes", Green for "No", Grey for "Not specified")
- Icons for different answer types (Warning for "Yes", Check for "No", etc.)
- Numbered question indicators for easy reference

### 3. Enhanced Survey Data Section
**File**: `lib/admin_dashboard_screen.dart`

**Changes**:
- Added conditional logic to detect new vs old survey format
- New format: Uses `_buildParsedSurveyQuestions()` for questions 1-8
- Old format: Falls back to existing patient info display
- Maintains backward compatibility

```dart
// Check if this is parsed survey data (new format) or old format
if (effectiveSurvey is Map && effectiveSurvey.containsKey('question1')) ...[
  // New parsed format - display questions 1-8
  ..._buildParsedSurveyQuestions(Map<String, dynamic>.from(effectiveSurvey)),
] else if (effectiveSurvey['patient_info'] != null) ...[
  // Old format - display patient info and other sections
```

### 4. Added Helper Methods
**File**: `lib/admin_dashboard_screen.dart`

**New Methods**:
- `_getAnswerColor(String answer)`: Returns appropriate color based on answer
- `_getAnswerIcon(String answer)`: Returns appropriate icon based on answer

### 5. Added Debug Logging
**File**: `lib/admin_dashboard_screen.dart`

**Added**:
- Debug prints to track survey data flow
- Helps identify if data is being received correctly from backend

## Survey Questions Displayed

The admin dashboard now displays these 8 questions with patient answers:

1. **Do you experience tooth pain or discomfort?**
2. **Do you have bleeding gums?**
3. **Do you have bad breath?**
4. **Do you have loose teeth?**
5. **Do you have difficulty chewing?**
6. **Do you experience jaw pain?**
7. **Do you have dry mouth?**
8. **Do you have visible cavities?**

## Visual Design

- **Question Format**: Each question is displayed in a numbered card
- **Answer Format**: Answers are shown in color-coded containers
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Red background for "Yes" answers (indicating potential issues)
  - Green background for "No" answers (indicating no issues)
  - Grey background for "Not specified" answers
- **Icons**: Warning icons for "Yes", check marks for "No", help icons for "Not specified"

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Complete a survey as a patient**
2. **Book an appointment**
3. **Login as admin**
4. **Navigate to Appointments tab**
5. **Click on appointment details**
6. **Verify survey data appears in the "Patient Self-Assessment Survey" section**

## Expected Result

The appointment details dialog should now show:
- Patient Information section
- Appointment Information section
- **Patient Self-Assessment Survey section** with all 8 questions and answers

## Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains backward compatibility:
- New appointments with parsed survey data will display the new format
- Old appointments with legacy survey data will still display correctly
- No existing functionality is broken

## Files Modified

- `lib/admin_dashboard_screen.dart` - Updated survey data display logic
