# Appointment Booking Restriction Implementation

## Overview
This implementation prevents patients from booking new appointments when they already have pending, approved, or scheduled appointments. This ensures that patients complete their existing appointments before booking new ones.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Appointment Status Checking
- **File**: `lib/appointment_booking_screen.dart`
- **Method**: `_checkExistingAppointments()`
- **Logic**: Checks for appointments with status 'pending', 'approved', or 'scheduled'
- **Result**: Sets `_hasExistingAppointments` flag and shows warning if active appointments exist

### 2. Booking Service Validation
- **File**: `lib/services/appointment_service.dart`
- **Method**: `bookAppointmentWithSurvey()`
- **Logic**: Additional validation before booking to check for existing active appointments
- **Result**: Returns error message if patient has active appointments

### 3. Visual Warning System
- **File**: `lib/appointment_booking_screen.dart`
- **Component**: `_buildExistingAppointmentsWarning()`
- **Features**:
  - Animated warning banner with red styling
  - Shows count of active appointments
  - Interactive "Tap to view details" button
  - Detailed appointment information dialog

### 4. Detailed Appointment Information
- **File**: `lib/appointment_booking_screen.dart`
- **Method**: `_showExistingAppointmentsDetails()`
- **Features**:
  - Shows all active appointments with status, service, date, and time
  - Color-coded status indicators
  - Clear explanation of why booking is blocked

### 5. Real-time Status Updates
- **File**: `lib/appointment_booking_screen.dart`
- **Method**: `didChangeDependencies()`
- **Logic**: Refreshes appointment status when screen becomes active
- **Benefit**: Automatically updates if appointments are completed elsewhere

### 6. Manual Refresh Option
- **File**: `lib/appointment_booking_screen.dart`
- **Feature**: Refresh button in app bar
- **Purpose**: Allows users to manually check if their appointments have been completed

## Status Types and Their Impact

### Blocking Statuses (Cannot Book New Appointments)
- **pending**: Appointment request submitted, awaiting admin review
- **approved**: Appointment approved by admin, waiting to be scheduled
- **scheduled**: Appointment has been scheduled with specific date/time

### Non-Blocking Statuses (Can Book New Appointments)
- **completed**: Appointment has been completed
- **cancelled**: Appointment was cancelled
- **rejected**: Appointment request was rejected

## User Experience Flow

### When Patient Has Active Appointments:
1. **Warning Banner**: Red animated banner appears at top of booking screen
2. **Blocked Booking**: Book button shows "Complete Existing Appointments First"
3. **Detailed Information**: Tap warning to see all active appointments
4. **Clear Guidance**: Message explains why booking is blocked

### When Patient Has No Active Appointments:
1. **Normal Flow**: Booking screen works normally
2. **No Warnings**: No warning banners displayed
3. **Full Access**: Patient can select service, date, and book appointment

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- Uses `ApiService.getAppointments()` to fetch real-time appointment data
- Checks appointment status from database, not local cache
- Handles network errors gracefully

### State Management
- `_hasExistingAppointments` boolean flag controls UI state
- `_existingAppointments` list stores active appointment details
- Automatic refresh on screen activation

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if appointment check fails
- Clear error messages for users
- Logging for debugging purposes

## Testing

### Test File: `test_appointment_restriction.dart`
This test file verifies:
1. Correct identification of active vs completed appointments
2. Proper blocking of booking when active appointments exist
3. Proper allowance of booking when no active appointments exist
4. Status filtering logic accuracy

### Running the Test
```bash
flutter run test_appointment_restriction.dart
```
