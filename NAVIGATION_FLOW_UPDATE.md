# Navigation Flow Update Summary

## Issue Fixed
Users were experiencing a redundant navigation flow where clicking "TAP TO CONTINUE" from the welcome screen would take them to an intermediate screen (NextScreen) that only had a login button, instead of going directly to the login screen.

## Problem
- **Before:** Welcome Screen → NextScreen → Login Screen
- **Issue:** NextScreen was redundant since guest mode was removed, making it just an extra step

## Solution
Updated the welcome screen to navigate directly to the login screen, bypassing the unnecessary NextScreen.

## Changes Made

### `lib/welcome_screen.dart`
**Modified:**
1. **Removed import:** `import './next_screen.dart';` (no longer needed)
2. **Updated navigation:** Changed from `NextScreen()` to `UnifiedLoginScreen()`

**Before:**
```dart
onTap: () {
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => const NextScreen(),
    ),
  );
},
```

**After:**
```dart
onTap: () {
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => const UnifiedLoginScreen(),
    ),
  );
},
```

## User Experience Improvement

### Before:
1. User sees welcome screen
2. Clicks "TAP TO CONTINUE"
3. Goes to NextScreen (which only has a login button)
4. Clicks "Login" button
5. Finally reaches the login screen

### After:
1. User sees welcome screen
2. Clicks "TAP TO CONTINUE"
3. Goes directly to login screen

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined Navigation:** Removed unnecessary intermediate screen
2. **Better UX:** Fewer clicks to reach the login screen
3. **Cleaner Flow:** More intuitive user journey
4. **Reduced Redundancy:** Eliminated redundant screen after guest mode removal

## Technical Impact

- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Cleaner navigation stack
- ✅ Reduced screen transitions
- ✅ Simplified user flow

## Files Affected

- **Modified:** `lib/welcome_screen.dart`
- **Unused:** `lib/next_screen.dart` (can be removed if no longer needed elsewhere)

## Verification

- ✅ Navigation flow works correctly
- ✅ User experience is improved
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
